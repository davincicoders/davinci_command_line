# Introduction

## Use Evernote to take notes

Evernote is a very powerful tool for taking and organizing notes. You can share
a notebook to collaborate with others or use it as a quick way to store references
for your own personal use.

Read the Evernote [guide](https://evernote.com/evernote/guide/mac/#1) for a quick tutorial

## Write down questions as they come to you

As you follow the exercises in this book, use Evernote to keep track of questions,
write down handy commands, and paste web links that are helpful learning resources.

Perhaps you have a question about `cd` like, "What happens when I try to `cd` into
a file instead of a directory?" Write down your questions so you can ask them in
class. Or better yet, write down questions so you can read a chapter without being
interrupted. At the very end, investigate your questions on the internet. The best
way to learn is to teach yourself and struggle with a concept instead of simply
getting an answer from a more experienced mentor.

## Developing Muscle Memory

To get the most out of your learning, not only do you have to struggle with ideas,
but you also have to struggle with executing commands. It won't do any good if you
memorize a list of commands, but never know how to use them. Sit at your computer
and type out the commands 10, 20, or even 100 times to make them second nature
to your programming experience.

### Don't copy paste

As you work on the exercises in this book, you'll want to copy and paste at times.
We get it. But remember that you'll be using these commands every day. Part of the
practice in answering the homework exercises is to help develop muscle memory.

## Commands we're going to learn

### Make Flash cards for each

Write the command on the front of the card (`pwd`) and what it does on the back
of the card (`print working directory`). You should be able to match each command
to its description and vice versa. This is important for being able to pair with
other programmers effectively.

If someone asks you what directory you're in, you should know to use `pwd` to
print working directory. If someone wants to `cd` somewhere, you should rememer
that you are changing directories.
